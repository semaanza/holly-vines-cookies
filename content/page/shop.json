For the wet ingredients, use one stick (half cup) of softened unsalted butter, three-quarters cup of granulated sugar, one large egg, one teaspoon of vanilla extract, and one to one and a half teaspoons of red food coloring. If you plan to make the cream cheese frosting, you'll need four ounces of softened cream cheese and half a cup of powdered sugar. Would you like the baking instructions for this smaller batch?"
